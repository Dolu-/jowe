This project is "work in progress"...
I didn't even find a proper name to it.

The main purpose for this project is to realize a complex economical and strategical game.
The generation of a random heightmap is the really first step.  
As I've been far enough, I realize that this first step could be useful for someone else purpose.
I think that this kind of map can be used for any other game.

Why Javascript ?
Why not ? Well, I'm really curious about everything, and I wanted to have a really dynamic map.
I'm not a Javascript expert, so I'm trying to do my best in coding it. See it like a way for me to learn javascript.
I'm convinced that there are a lot of optimization to bring to this project, so feel free to tell my about it.

What's missing for this project to be completly done ?
There is much more to do to finalize this project, here are the main next steps :
- Create all required tools to manipulate a map (that's where I am for now)
