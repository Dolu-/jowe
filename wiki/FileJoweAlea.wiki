= Jowe-Alea =

This file contains the Mash() and Alea() objects (original work by Johannes Baag√∏e).<br>
It's an alternative to the function "Math.random" (with equal performance) and possibility to repeat random sequences.<br>
It comes from http://baagoe.com/en/RandomMusings/javascript/


== Details ==

There's not much to say about it. I've made very small cosmetic changes to the original version. If you want to know more about it, go have a look on the author's website.

The file is facultative, you can use the "jowe" core engine without it because it will check if it exists at start. If not, the javascript function "Math.random" is used.<br>
The main interest of the Alea function is to offer a way to repeat random sequences. Furthermore it offers the same performance as the function "Math.random".
