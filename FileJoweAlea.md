# Jowe-Alea #

This file contains the Mash() and Alea() objects (original work by Johannes Baag√∏e).<br>
It's an alternative to the function "Math.random" (with equal performance) and possibility to repeat random sequences.<br>
It comes from <a href='http://baagoe.com/en/RandomMusings/javascript/'>http://baagoe.com/en/RandomMusings/javascript/</a>


<h2>Details</h2>

There's not much to say about it. I've made very small cosmetic changes to the original version. If you want to know more about it, go have a look on the author's website.<br>
<br>
The file is facultative, you can use the "jowe" core engine without it because it will check if it exists at start. If not, the javascript function "Math.random" is used.<br>
The main interest of the Alea function is to offer a way to repeat random sequences. Furthermore it offers the same performance as the function "Math.random".<br>
